THE FIRST HOUSE

OBJECT OF THE FIRST HOUSE: The object of The First House is to have the highest points at the end of the game.
NUMBER OF PLAYERS: 2 to 4 players
MATERIALS: A rulebook, the deck of cards needed to play the game, a game board, a place to store the cards, and cards to use in the game.
TYPE OF GAME: Strategic Board Game
AUDIENCE: 10+
OVERVIEW OF THE FIRST HOUSE
The First House is played with two players. Each player will control a house in the game and will be making different trades and purchases to get the most points. The goal of the game is to be the one who has the highest points at the end of the game.

SETUP
To begin setup, each player will pick their character deck and place it face down in front of them. Next, they will choose their board to use and place the corresponding token on it. You may set your board as high or as low as you like, but the goal of the game is to get the most points.

After everyone has decided their board, they will take the necessary equipment and place it near the board. There are also three dice to be used in the game, but they are not required. After everyone has chosen their decks, they will take the three dice and place them facing up on the board. After everyone has their decks, they will take the three dice and place them facing down on the board. Afterwards, all players will take a moment to look at their stakes and equipment. You may pick up as much of your equipment as you like, but it is recommended to leave the board area open at the end to allow more airflow. After everyone has their equipment, they will place their equipment on their board to match their equipment.

GAMEPLAY
There are three ways to win The First House. You can either win by scoring the highest points at the end of the game, or you can win by being the player who has the highest points at the end of the game.

To win by scoring the highest points at the end of the game, you must be the player who scores the highest points at the end of the game. In The First House, scoring the highest points earns you points equal to that score.

You may also win by being the player who has the highest points at the end of the game. This is because the higher a player scores, the greater the reward they receive. Players earn points by being on the top of their stakes, and the more stakes they own.

GAMEPLAY
After the first few games, players will earn more rewards according to their scores. Each player will earn a bonus depending on the number on their board. Players earn 7’ points, 10’ points, and 15’ points. The player who scores the highest points earns a bonus of 10 points each, while the player who scores the lowest points earns a bonus of 5 points each.

GAMEPLAY
The first player is determined by the board and will begin the game. The game follows a clockwise direction on the board. Each player will take their starting point and follow the clockwise direction on the board. Players have the option to either start from their starting point, or from a higher-trailing card. Players may also choose to start from a lower-trailing card.

There are a few special circumstances that may result in a player starting from a higher-trailing card. If you start from a lower-trailing card, and your board has a star on it, then you earn additional points. If you start from a higher-trailing card, and your board has a number, then the player who starts from the higher-trailing card earns the number of points. 


If you choose to start from the higher-trailing card, you will follow the same rules above for a lower-trailing card. If the card has a number, you will earn the number of points, and vice versa. 


Players will trade cards as they trade equipment. You may only hold cards of the number indicated on the card, and you must discard cards that are lower in value than the card you are trading for. You may also discard cards that are in your hand, but cannot be discarded. You may do this before or after trading. If you do not trade for a card, then it is in your hand but cannot be discarded.

SCORING
The player who scores the highest points wins the game. Each card that they hold is worth a certain number of points. All other cards that are in their hand are worth half the point value. For example, a 5 could be worth 10 points, and a 3 could be worth 15 points. Points are calculated by dividing the value of a card by the number on the card.

The player who holds the highest points

JACK OFF

OBJECT OF JACK OFF: The object of Jack Off is to be the first team to have all their team’s pieces in a position to jack off.
NUMBER OF PLAYERS: 2 players
MATERIALS: A board, a piece of wood, a dice, and a marker
TYPE OF GAME: Board game
AUDIENCE: Adult
OVERVIEW OF JACK OFF
Jack Off is a board game for 2 players. A team must be able to maneuver their pieces to the correct position on the board without causing damage to other teams.

The game starts with the player who has the most control over the board at the start of the game. They place their piece on the starting space marked with a circle. The first player will decide who will be the first player at the start of the game.

HOW TO SETUP JACK OFF
The board should be assembled and set up near the game board in such a way that all teams are able to reach the starting space. The starting space is set up so that every team is able to reach it without causing damage to the other team.

Place the board so that the starting space is facing each team’s starting space. The number of spaces marked on the board is for reference only, and the board may be rotated around the board to accommodate the different team’s needs.

Place the board so that the space marked with a circle is the starting space for all teams. The number of spaces marked on the board is for reference only, and the space marked with a circle may be rotated around the board to accommodate the different team’s needs.

Place the marker on each corner of the board, starting with the designated corner. Each team will place their marker exactly where the board indicates. The first team will take their marker to the starting space marked with a circle.

GAMEPLAY
The first team will begin the game by rolling the dice. This will determine the number of spaces that each team will be able to move their piece in the direction of the dice roll.

After each roll, each team will place their piece on the corresponding space. The first team may choose to move their piece backwards or forwards depending on the space they roll into.

If they land on the space marked with a circle, they move their piece in the opposite direction of the dice roll.

If they land on the space marked with a square, they move in the opposite direction of the dice roll.

END OF GAME
The game ends when a team is able to move their piece into the designated space. The player who is the first team to move their piece out of their starting space is the winner.

In the case of a tie, the first team is the one who has moved their piece the farthest.

TYPE OF GAME: Strategic Board Game
AUDIENCE:  10+
OVERVIEW OF LORD OF THE RINGS
In Lord of The Rings, you have 7 years to become the best Lord of the Rings player. This is done by advancing the board by advancing your characters. The board is divided into 4 quadrants- the Middle Quarter, the Top Quarter, and the Bottom Quarter. Each of these quadrants has a board of its own. The goal of the game is to build the best deck for the game by advancing your characters’ positions.

SETUP
Each player will pick their characters and take their positions on the board. The Middle Quarter is the starting area and the board is placed in a way that every player has an equal chance of being on it. Every player will take a card from the baggable and place it facing their character’s location. 

After everyone has had a turn, the Top Quarter is extended to include all players. The top card of the deck is flipped and then the players take their positions on the corresponding spots on the board. The board is shuffled and the player with the highest card wins the game.

GAMEPLAY
The game begins with the player with the highest card in their hand. Each player will take a card from the baggable facing their character’s location. The player with the highest card is the one who starts the game with the highest card.

The game continues this way, alternating turns for players to advance their position on the board. 

If you have a card that allows you to move on top of another player’s character, move that card into your bag. If you do not have a card that allows you to move on top of another player’s character, skip this step. You may use all your characters’ moves in any order.

If you have a card that allows you to move one of your characters forward on the board, play that card. If you do not have a card that allows you to move one of your characters forward, skip this step.

If you have a card that allows you to move a character from the Middle Quarter to the Top Quarter, move that character to your Bag. If you do not have a card that allows you to move a character from the Middle Quarter to the Top Quarter, skip this step.

If you have a card that allows you to move a character from the Bottom Quarter to the Middle Quarter, move that character to your Bag. If you do not have a card that allows you to move a character from the Bottom Quarter to the Middle Quarter, skip this step.

If you have a card that allows you to move a character into the Top Quarter, move that character to your Bag. If you do not have a card that allows you to move a character into the Top Quarter, skip this step.

If you have a card that allows you to move a character into the Middle Quarter, or the Top Quarter, another player’s character out of the Middle Quarter, or the Top Quarter. Another player may decide which zone they wish to advance their character in. Each player may only have one card allowed to move in the Top Quarter, Middle Quarter, Bottom Quarter, and Middle Quarter.

If you do not have a card that allows you to move forward in the Middle Quarter, skip this step and move the card for your next turn.

ENDING THE GAME
After everyone has moved their characters forward on the board, the top card of the deck is flipped and the game ends. The player with the highest card is the winner.

MAGE KNIGHT

OBJECT OF MAGE KNIGHT: The objective of Mage Knight is to complete the desired scenario and win the game.
NUMBER OF PLAYERS: 2 to 5 players
MATERIALS: A rulebook, a deck of cards, 4 character figures, a pawn and a board.
TYPE OF GAME: Dice management card game
AUDIENCE: 8+
OVERVIEW OF MAGE KNIGHT
Mage Knight is played like a traditional bidding war game, with the goal of both players being to get the most points before their opponents. The winner will be declared the winner after everyone has completed their objective and the game is won. 

The goal of the game is to collect points by completing certain objectives and avoiding other players from scoring. 

There are different objectives that can be completed in this game. There is Victory Point collecting, which is done by scoring Victory Points, and there is Counter-Attack scoring, which is done by limiting the number of cards that can be played in a turn. 

The best strategy is to use the board to your advantage, by giving cards to other players and asking them to play cards that you have available. The objective of the game is to score more Victory Points than your opponents in as short a time as possible.

SETUP
To begin setup, you will need a deck of cards. The goal of the game is to have a full deck of 52 cards, which is what the deck will contain. 

Place the deck facedown near a computer screen so that all players can access it easily. Each player will pick their character and set up their respective boards accordingly. 

The remaining cards will be shuffled and placed adjacent to the computer screen, so that each player may see it easily. The deck will be shuffled again and the players will place their character figures on the corresponding spots on their boards. 

The screen will be turned on so that the computer can view the cards that have been played this turn. The computer will then draw a card from the deck to show each player. 

The game is ready to begin!

GAMEPLAY
The computer will play a randomly selected card from the deck and place it face up on the board. The computer will keep this card faceup on the board until all players have played a card. 

If a player has played a Legendary card, they will receive a special action that will allow them to collect that card’s effect and move their pawn forward based on its power. Cards that have a high power will allow the player to move their pawn faster, while cards that have a low power will cause the player to lose movement points. 

Legendary cards have a 4th power that will allow the player to move the character figure of that card several spaces.

Using the computer, players will choose their characters and place their character figures on their respective spots on their boards. Each player will then draw two cards from the deck and place one face up on each card. The computer will place the other facedown to the bottom of the deck. 

The computer will then draw two more cards from the deck and place them face up on the bottom of the deck. The computer will look through the deck and choose a card from the top. Players will then draw two cards from the top of the deck to add up to 6 cards to their hand. 

The computer will then shuffle the cards and show each player their hand. The player who has the highest card draws will start the next round. 

SCORING
During the scoring phase, the computer will look through the scenario card and tally the cards that have been played in that scenario. If a player has played a Legendary card, they will receive a special action that will allow them to collect that card’s effect and move their pawn forward based on its power. Cards that have a high power will allow the player to move their pawn faster, while cards that have a low power will cause the player to lose movement points. 

The computer will then discard one card and show the remaining cards to the remaining players. The player with the highest card draws will start the next round.

END OF GAME
The game can end in three ways. Either the computer will have scored the required 6 cards, the players will have won the game, the computer will have discarded a card, or the game will have ended. Either way, the winner is the one who has scored the highest number of cards during the scenario. 

Enjoy!

BASIC CROSSING

The basic rules of basic crossing are:

Each player starts with two opposing colored crosses.
Players alternate crossing their respective colored crossbars.
Crossbars connect the two corresponding colored crossbars.  If a player starts crossing his crossbar then the crossbar runs diagonally across the board from him.
There are two ways for a player to start crossing a color-bar:

A player can start crossing a colored crossbar by crossing his entire crossbar in a single horizontal motion.
If a player starts crossing his crossbar in a fashion that would cause any other player to miss the crossing, then that player starts a new color-bar crossing.
SETUP
To set up the game, each player places his colored crossbars on the starting area of the board. For each player, one colored crossbar is set aside for that game. The board is then divided into four areas, each containing five areas. Each player places his crossbars in the starting area of each area. The top area is for the first player and the bottom area is for the last player. The board is then shuffled, and a random player is chosen at random from the remaining players.  The deck is then placed centrally as well as a random player who has not already been chosen. The dice are then dealt out and each player secretly pulls one to add their two crossbars to the board.  The player with the highest score wins the game!

GAMEPLAY
The first player takes his turn and rolls the dice. The player with the highest score starts a new colored crossbar, and the player with the lowest score does not. This player starts a new colored crossbar when he rolls the dice. The game continues this way, players crossing their colored crossbars starting from the lowest player. Once a player crosses his colored crossbar, he is no longer able to start a new colored crossbar in that area. This player then has to start a new colored crossbar in the area directly opposite of his current one.

Once a player starts a new colored crossbar, there are a couple of options as to how he starts his next colored crossbar. The first is to roll a blue crossbar. Once a player rolls a blue crossbar, that player starts a new colored crossbar adjacent to his existing crossbar. The other way around is to roll a red crossbar, which means that each new crossbar rolls one. Each player starts with one crossbar in each color-bar area.

Once a player starts a new colored crossbar, the first player may choose to start crossing his colored crossbars on his first or last colored crossbars. If the player starts a new colored crossbar on his last crossbar, he must start from the area of the same color-bar.

Once a player starts a new colored crossbar, he can only start a new color-bar if his previous color-bar is intersected with a color-bar of another color-bar. If this crossbar is already occupied, then the player can use any number of blue crosses, red crosses, or any other color-bars to move the second color-bar along the tracks. The second color-bar is then added to the board in the same way.

Once a player starts a new colored crossbar, he can move his colored crossbars by rolling dice. Once the dice are rolled, each player must move the corresponding portion of the board in the same direction as the dice. If you roll a blue cross, move your red crossbar one space, and if you roll a red cross, move your blue crossbar one space. If you roll a blue cross, move your red crossbar one space, and if you roll a red cross, move your blue crossbar one space.

Once a player starts a new colored crossbar, he cannot move his colored crossbars in any direction. If you land on a colored crossbar and your dice roll a number, then your new color-bar is added to that crossbar as well.

SCORING
After a player has moved all of the colored crossbars of a color-bar in a straight path, then the player’s score is added to that area.

If you land on any crossbar of another color-bar, then your score is added to that bar as well.

END OF GAME
If a player crosses his colored crossbar in a straight path, he is done. The player with the highest score wins the game!

ROYAL VISIT

OBJECTIVE OF ROYAL VISIT: The objective of Royal Visit is to have the most points at the end of the game.
NUMBER OF PLAYERS: 2 to 4 players
MATERIALS: A rulebook, a gameboard, a deck of cards, a flat surface, and a gameboard board.
TYPE OF GAME: Abstract, tile-placing board game
AUDIENCE: Teen, Adult
OVERVIEW OF ROYAL VISIT
Royal Visit involves two opposing teams of players trying to be the first team to collect 15 points.  If you are a team that uses cards, you will most likely be playing this game with a few cubes and a few pieces of paper. If you are a team that wants to have fun, they will most likely be using the board game to play with other teams.  Both teams will use their pieces to move the pieces of their team’s team.  Players will use their board to move their pieces to the correct space on the board.

SETUP
The deck of cards should be shuffled and then the cards may be placed facing down to form a draw pile.  Place the board so that all four corners are facing each other and the draw pile is centered over the board.  Place the remaining cards facing down to the draw pile.  Place the two sides up on the board for the game.

Place the board in the center of the play area where all players are able to reach it.  Place the board so that the cards are pointing toward the center of the board.  Place the board so that the cards are centered over the board.  Place the draw pile in the center of the play area, next to the board.

Place the board so that the slots are facing each other and the draw pile is centered over it.  Place the deck of cards in a line connecting the two ends of the board.  A player’s turn will start facing the player who is last played. 

GAMEPLAY
The deck of cards will rotate through players like it was shuffling a deck of cards.  Cards will be placed facedown in the middle of the board, and then the draw pile will be collected in the center of the board.  Draw Placement
Draw Placement is done by looking at the top card of the draw pile and deciding if you want to play the card, or if you want to discard it.  If you choose to play the card, it will be placed face up next to the card you choose to discard.  If you want to discard the card, you must do so, and then draw a new one from the draw pile.

If you wish to move your piece along the board, you must play the card that will move your piece along the board.  You must always move your piece along the board, regardless of what is on the card.  If you move into an open space and can, you must.  Move out of an open space, or discard a card, and re-roll a dice roll.

ENDING THE GAME
The game can end in three ways. One, your team wins! Two, your team is behind! or three, you lose!

If your team wins the game, you have won!  If your team is behind, you lost!

If you discard a card, you have to play another one.
